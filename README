All About The Goods:
================================

This was a fun project I did for a Real-Time Systems course
at the U of Manitoba. Plays music on a Commodore 64 SID chip
using a PlayStation(2) controller.



What it can do so far:
-----------------------

Configure voice #1 of the SID chip. Such enticing configurables as:
  - Triangle, Sawtooth, Sine, Random waveforms.
  - ADSR Envelope (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#ADSR_envelope)
  - Volume!

Configure screen:
  - Brightness! All four levels of it.

Play notes!:
 - Shoulder buttons for octave & sharp selection, face buttons for notes.
 - Even some that don't exist! It's like the X-Files had an episode about synthesizers.

Save settings to EEPROM:
 - That's... probably working? Still need to test it.



What I want it to do: (future features)
-----------------------

Storage:
 - Save my silly songs to an SD card.
 - Replay.
 - Save to PC.

Have head-to-head-to-head jamming:
 - Have two more controllers for the other two voices.
 - Everyting's better with friends!

Quick instrument switching:
 - Maybe just between voices at first.
 - Cool to have everyone be able to switch quickly / independantly.

Bring in external source:
 - Pass through voice 3/filter

Get some of the nuttier SID stuff in there:
 - Low-pass / high pass filters.
 - Freq cuttoffs.
 - Freq pulse width adjust.
 - Resonance.
 - Sync voices (makes interesting effects so I hear).
 - Ring modulation between multiple voices (for solo play, also for effects).

Get random effects ideas from the demoscene
 - Allow quick on / off from the circle button.
 - Guitar peddle type effects (wah-wah, etc).
