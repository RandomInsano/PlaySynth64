All About The Goods:
================================

This was a fun project I did for a Real-Time Systems course
at the U of M. Plays music on a Commodore 64 SID chip using
a PlayStation(2) controller.

Planning on extending it once I've got some time. And uploading
the electrical schematics so others can build this bad-ass
musical machine!
